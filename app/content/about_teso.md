As a fan of the Elder Scrolls game-series, I thought that it would be a very nice subject for a Q+A-site. As there is a lot of games in the series - which is also very big games - it is very much likely that questions pop up from time to time. The purpose with this site is for helping out each other in a co-operative manner, which in some ways may be even more yielding and fun than browsing walktroughs or game guides.

So... on this site, you can register a user and then start asking, answering and commenting. You can manage your profile and the avatars is connected to [Gravatar](https://sv.gravatar.com/) and based on yor entered e-mail address.

Have fun!
